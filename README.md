# Road-Accident-Analysis
This Dashboard shows the analysis for Road accidents in America for the year 2021 - 2022. It also shows the severity rate of each accidents and casualties.

I created a interactive dashboard regarding Road Accident Analysis.

Steps involved :
Data Extraction from Kaggle: Kaggle is a popular platform for datasets, and it's a good choice for obtaining data for your analysis. Make sure to choose a dataset that is relevant and comprehensive for road accident analysis.

Data Transformation in Power Query: Power Query is a powerful tool for data transformation and cleaning. This step involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, renaming columns, and structuring it in a way that is suitable for analysis.

Loading Data into Power BI: After transforming the data in Power Query, you load it into Power BI. Power BI is a robust data visualization and business intelligence tool that allows you to create interactive dashboards.

Creating the Dashboard: This is the core of your project. You've mentioned using various charts and DAX queries to create a comprehensive dashboard. Here are some things you might consider:

Time Intelligence: Analyzing accident data over time often involves creating a calendar date table and using time intelligence functions like YTD (Year-to-Date) and YoY (Year-over-Year) calculations.

Data Modeling: Creating relationships between multiple tables is crucial for building meaningful visualizations. Ensure that your data model is well-structured to support your analysis.

KPIs (Key Performance Indicators): KPIs can help summarize key metrics related to road accidents. Creating KPI cards or visuals can provide a quick overview of important statistics.

Custom Columns and Measures: Creating custom columns and measures in DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) can help you derive specific insights and metrics that are not present in the raw data.

Insights gained from the analysis are:

Total CY Casualties was 195.7K

Total Current Year Accidents was 144.4K

Current Year Fatal Casualties was 2.9K

Current Year Serious Casualties was 27.0K

Import Images: Importing relevant images, such as maps or accident scene photos, can add context and enhance the visual appeal of your dashboard.
